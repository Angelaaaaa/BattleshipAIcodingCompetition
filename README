Battleship competition engine from John Gietzen. Realized for the Battleship AI coding competition at StackOverflow [1].
Algorithms from the StackOverflow coding competition [1] and UGIdotNET coding competition [2].

Rules of the game:

    1. The game is be played on a 10x10 grid.
    2. Each competitor will place each of 5 ships (of lengths 2, 3, 3, 4, 5) on their grid.
    3. No ships may overlap, but they may be adjacent.
    4. The competitors then take turns firing single shots at their opponent.
    5. The opponent will notify the competitor if the shot sinks, hits, or misses.
    6. Game play ends when all of the ships of any one player are sunk.
    

Rules of the competition:

    1. The spirit of the competition is to find the best Battleship algorithm.
    2. Anything that is deemed against the spirit of the competition will be grounds for disqualification.
    3. Interfering with an opponent is against the spirit of the competition.
    4. A limit of 4 seconds per game is allotted to each competitor.
    5. Running out of time results in losing the current game.
    6. Any unhandled exception will result in losing the current game.
    7. Max code total size (un-compressed) of an entry is 1 MB.
    8. Your entry must implement the IBattleshipOpponent interface.

Scoring:

    1. Best 501 games out of 1000 games is the winner of a match.
    2. All competitors will play matched against each other, round-robin style.

Good luck! Have fun!
